Hello!

User flows!

User downloads HupPup, signs up, creates their profile, last thing is location, then show them a list of runner profiles in the area, allow them to book an opening for a meet and greet, and land them on a dashboard where they can see their upcoming appointment(s) and then tabs for runners, profile, account, share buttons, feedback forms ...

Runner downloads HupPup, signs up as a runner, creates their profile, last thing is location, then show them Runner Trainers in the area, allow them to book an opening for an interview run, then ... that's going to be a whole process, but basically the rule is no assholes, and the strategy is going to be that if I go for a run with you and you don't seem like an asshole, and the background check and a skim of the socials agree, you're probably not an asshole, and if someone can prove to remain not an asshole for a time, I can probably trust them to judge whether someone is an asshole or not, too. I think about an hour should do. And for Runner Trainers, I'd probably want webhooks on their Strava activity and that be part of verifying that they actually ran with this person.
